2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-190#1 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDRE cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/CORE_XSDB.UUT_MASTER/U_ICON_INTERFACE/U_CMD5/shift_reg_in_reg[2] in site SLICE_X83Y15 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDRE cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/CORE_XSDB.UUT_MASTER/U_ICON_INTERFACE/U_CMD5/shift_reg_in_reg[1] is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option 'objects : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~ "*BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_inst/SERIES7_BSCAN.bscan_inst/TCK"}]' of constraint 'create_clock' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '52' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

CLKC-3#1 Advisory
Clock Buffer has LOC and not CLOCK_REGION  
The BUFGCE cell u_ibert_gth_core/inst/QUAD[0].u_q/CH[0].u_ch/u_buf_dmonitorclk has a LOC constraint, but using the CLOCK_REGION property instead would give more flexibility to the Placer to select the appropriate routing/distribution track.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-3#2 Advisory
Clock Buffer has LOC and not CLOCK_REGION  
The BUFGCE cell u_ibert_gth_core/inst/QUAD[0].u_q/CH[1].u_ch/u_buf_dmonitorclk has a LOC constraint, but using the CLOCK_REGION property instead would give more flexibility to the Placer to select the appropriate routing/distribution track.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-3#3 Advisory
Clock Buffer has LOC and not CLOCK_REGION  
The BUFGCE cell u_ibert_gth_core/inst/QUAD[0].u_q/CH[2].u_ch/u_buf_dmonitorclk has a LOC constraint, but using the CLOCK_REGION property instead would give more flexibility to the Placer to select the appropriate routing/distribution track.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-3#4 Advisory
Clock Buffer has LOC and not CLOCK_REGION  
The BUFGCE cell u_ibert_gth_core/inst/QUAD[0].u_q/CH[3].u_ch/u_buf_dmonitorclk has a LOC constraint, but using the CLOCK_REGION property instead would give more flexibility to the Placer to select the appropriate routing/distribution track.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-45#1 Advisory
GTHE3_COMMON REFCLKMONITOR pin should drive BUFG  
The GTHE3_COMMON cell u_ibert_gth_core/inst/QUAD[0].u_q/u_common/u_gthe3_common pin u_ibert_gth_core/inst/QUAD[0].u_q/u_common/u_gthe3_common/REFCLKOUTMONITOR0 should be driving a global clock buffer such as BUFGCE, BUFGCE_DIV, or BUFGCTRL, but not a BUFG_GT. Instead, it is driving a FDRE cell u_ibert_gth_core/inst/QUAD[0].u_q/u_common/U_COMMON_REGS/reg_20e/I_EN_STAT_EQ1.U_STAT/xsdb_reg_reg[3] (and 1 other loads).
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-45#2 Advisory
GTHE3_COMMON REFCLKMONITOR pin should drive BUFG  
The GTHE3_COMMON cell u_ibert_gth_core/inst/QUAD[0].u_q/u_common/u_gthe3_common pin u_ibert_gth_core/inst/QUAD[0].u_q/u_common/u_gthe3_common/REFCLKOUTMONITOR1 should be driving a global clock buffer such as BUFGCE, BUFGCE_DIV, or BUFGCTRL, but not a BUFG_GT. Instead, it is driving a FDRE cell u_ibert_gth_core/inst/QUAD[0].u_q/u_common/U_COMMON_REGS/reg_20e/I_EN_STAT_EQ1.U_STAT/xsdb_reg_reg[4] (and 1 other loads).
